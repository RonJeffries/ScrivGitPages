<p class="itemText">### Welcome</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Welcome to scriv-git-pages! This is a little book about how to use Scrivener to produce a little book on GitHub Pages.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">I have had and admired the Scrivener app for a long time, and always wanted to write something using it. I’ve tried it a few times for NaNoWr...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Style, Scrivener's and Mine</p>
<p class="itemText">Scrivener allows you–indeed encourages you–to use paragraph and font styles. You can style your headers, indent your paragraphs, show text in bold or italic, just about anything you’d like to do. Its approach has two advantages at least.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">First of all, you can lay out your work any way you wish, so that its screen appearance is whatever works best for you as you write. You can have a plain typewriter look, or a fully formatted finalized kind of look.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Second, Scrivener does a good job of exporti...</p>

<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Starting the Project</p>
<p class="itemText">We’re here to create a little “book”, showing how to create the GitHub pages you will be reading when this is all done. This chapter starts at the beginning, though it may not wind up being the first page of the “book”.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">I’ve just started with a blank Scrivener project, which I named “GitHub-Pages” and saved in Dropbox/Apps/Scrivener, where my shared Scrivener projects live.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Right now, what I see on the screen looks like this:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">#</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">I’ve got View > Text Editing > Show invisibles turned on right n...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Default Formatting</p>
<p class="itemText">You set your initial font and paragraph info in Scrivener > Preferences, (command-comma). My info looks like this:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">#</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">To change that information, you can click the controls at the top of the paragraph, for example, to show the fonts panel:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">I could change the face from Arial if I wanted to. I don’t. I am going to turn off the Show Invisibles, however.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Note in the Formatting window above that the two paragraphs, the quotation and the name, are adjacent. When you’re on that window, you could u...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Styles</p>
<p class="itemText">Scrivener lets you assign “Styles” to paragraphs, and you can control how those styles get compiled into the output. So, in principle, I could set up a “Heading 2” style such that when I format a paragraph with Heading 2, it would look different in my editor, and (I believe) I could make it compile with the ## in front of it that signify H2 to Markdown. For now, I’m not going to do that: I’m going to type my own Markdown marks, because I’m used to it.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Perhaps we’ll come back to the topic of sty...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Sections</p>
<p class="itemText">Set up the document and folder levels we like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Documents, Sections, Layouts</p>
<p class="itemText">Warning: I’m going to get the terms wrong here, but I’ll do my best to correct to Scrivener terms.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Each document in Scrivener is a “Section” and has a “Section Type” for compilation. Associated with each Section Type, there is a “Layout”, which tells Scrivener how to format the compiled output for that section. We’ll use that to control what comes out, to be fed into GitHub Pages.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">You could do this incrementally, or later, but I think it’s best to set up our initial Section Types now. We’ll ha...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Regrets, I've had a few</p>
<p class="itemText">Since I mentioned regrets, and since I always do “Programming in Public”, or in this case “Scrivening in Public”, here’s what’s on my mind. I’m going to start creating a few index cards on the cork board, to get a general idea of what might be in this little book. And it becomes clear right away that those ideas will fall into classifications, and some of them could be quite large.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">For example, we may have some ideas about compiling to markdown. We may have some discussion about the details of ...</p>

<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Testing the Compile</p>
</li>
<hr class="afterTitle"/>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Created the folder</p>
<p class="itemText">I’ve created a folder, called Testing the Compile, and this document inside it, called Created the folder. In our final compilation, we’ll want the title of the folder to show up and not the title of this document. Now I’ll add one more document, to better test our Sub-Section notion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Another couple of paragraphs</p>
<p class="itemText">This is being written in a second sub-document, called “Another couple of paragraphs”. The Scrivener binder looks like this:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">#</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">This should be enough to let us see whether our sections are working right. Let’s look at the compile:</p>

<li>
<p class="itemTitle">Looking at compile</p>
<p class="itemText">Just for grins, this is yet another sub-document, called Looking at compile. Here’s what the compile window looks like now:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">#</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Notice that the sub documents in the folder are called Sub-Section, just as we intended. That happened automatically, because of that structure setup we did. You can see that the Section Types are all shown in italic. That means they were automatically defined from structure. We could set them explicitly if we wanted to. But we don’t. I *would* like to see what the comp...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="itemTitle">The compiled markdown</p>
<p class="itemText">I open the compiled markdown file in Sublime, my text editor, and it all looks pretty good, except that in addition to all the pictures showing up in line in the text, as they should, they are all at the bottom of the compiled file as well. It looks like this:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>

<p class="itemTitle">Titles</p>
<p class="itemText">To get the titles to come out, we need to do a bit of layout assignment. I think maybe we don’t need to create new layouts yet, we might just be able to tick some options. Let’s try, inside compile:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">#</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">There’s already a layout defined, Text Section with Heading, that nearly does the job. I notice it’s using H1 (one # sign), but maybe that’s OK. Now the compiled Markdown looks like this:</p>

<p class="itemText">Ah, yes. In the tags subtab of compile, it lists the metadata. Way down in the lower right, you can delete and add the stuff it includes. It’s basically putting YAML at the top of your compiled document. That’s actually something you might want on another day. Today is not that day. I’ll delete those items now:</p>

<p class="itemText">Let’s go for it! Let’s publish what we have right now, and put it in a page with a known name, which we’ll retain for historical purposes. (I wonder if anyone will ever read this. A conversation yesterday tried to assure me that my mission is to emit my own behavior and not worry about whether other people find it useful. Years of Irish Catholic upbringing, however, make that hard to do.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Compile and Folders</p>
<p class="itemText">That url, with /v20180615.md/v20180615.html, is what I had to use because of how Scrivener does a compile of an MMD, it needs to export all your pictures, and all your text, into the same folder. And the compile window has only one name field in it, so they create a folder with the name you give, and a markdown .md file of the same name, and then when GitHub compiles the site, you get that name with .html instead of .md. Thus the odd name.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Now what I’d *like* would be to have a folder name like...</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">ToC and Pages</p>
<p class="itemText">It’s about time to think more seriously about breaking this little book up into pages, setting up a Table of Contents, and inter-page linking. As in all things, I’ll think about this broadly and try to go about it incrementally.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">### Splitting</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">I’ve decided to split this little book into separate HTML files, one per Section. (We’ll describe below just what a Section is, but for now, it’s basically a chapter.) Scrivener can help with this to a degree: you can get it to put a special separator lin...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Splitting</p>
<p class="itemText">I think it’s time to start splitting up the files. I’ll publish a few more versions, or maybe subsets, as I do this, in case anyone is watching, and for historical purposes (that is, because I want to). But the main thrust will be to try to get a published multi-page version onto GitHub Pages ASAP.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">To that end, I think I’ll just split this one big file into one file per section, and name them 01,02, and so on. That should be a simple-enough script.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">The first thing is to get Scrivener to put a ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Prev, Top, Next</p>
<p class="itemText">There has been a great public outcry for links between the pages. Well, Brian Kelly, @spilth on Twitter, mentioned it. I told him to cool his jets, we’re only on version 0.0.1 or something but he called me on the “feedback welcome” typo I made in my initial announcement.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">But it does seem to me that we should be able to put in some quick links with the new little splitter Ruby script. I’m going to break my own rules again, and not TDD this. Hold my beer.</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Image References Fail</p>
<p class="itemText">In all the excitement, I didn’t mention above that there was a problem with my references to images. I fixed them up by hand in the previous release. The problem is this:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">When you put an image into a Scrivener document, you just drag it in, and there it goes. It compiles correct MultiMarkdown for it automatically, as part of the MMD compilation features. If you’ve dragged in `image_file_name.png`, for example, it compiles:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">`\![][image_file_name]`</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">right in place, and then at the very end of th...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Image References Alternative</p>
<p class="itemText">The ever-marvelous AmberV (Ioa Petra'ka)  on the Scrivener forum pointed me to §21.4.1 in the manual, an alternate way of putting images into the text. I’ll try it here.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">![A picture of me working right now[(arbitrary)</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">I found §21.4.1 a bit confusing. For me, what worked was this:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">1. If the desired image isn't already in the binder, add it using (idk) Gear > Add > Existing Files. It will show up in Research.</p>
<p class="itemText">2. Create a conventional Markdown image link where you want the picture to appear, Put...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Refactoring First</p>
<p class="itemText">OK, our issue is that Scrivener puts references, including images, at the end of the whole document. When we split the document into multiple files, one per section, each section needs to have those references at its end, or its images won’t link up.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">So our mission, and we do wish to accept it, is to strip out the references from the end, and copy them onto the end of every output file before we close it. My cunning plan is roughly this:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">1. Put a separator at the end of the document, so that t...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Image References</p>
<p class="itemText">Here I am at the coffee shop. My cunning plan is to add a suffix line to the end of the whole file, which will look to our Ruby code like just another separator. Then, after chunking the file, the last chunk should be the references. I’ll remove the last chunk from the array, saving it elsewhere, and as I loop through the remaining chunks, I’ll append the reference chunk.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">This should be a piece of cake. First the suffix. I think that’s in the compile format. Sure enough, here’s what I did:</p>

<p class="itemText">...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Better Links</p>
<p class="itemText">I decided to improve the links between articles, just because I could. Let me make a few quick points though.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">First, improving the links is probably not the most valuable new feature for building this booklet. Contenders for most important include automating the creation of the table of contents, which I am making entirely by hand, and fully automating the splitting process. And those things might be more valuable to you, the reader as well.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Second, with the making of links so nicely factored ...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Creating the ToC</p>
<p class="itemText">I think the remaining priorities for this little effort are the table of contents, and setting it up to be fully automated. By “fully”, I mean that issuing a compile should automatically run the Ruby script that creates our individual files, plugs in the links, and creates the table of contents. I probably will not go so far as to automate the git commit and push to GitHub. We’ll see.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Since creating the table of contents requires some file-mangling, I think I’ll start with that before automatio...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Post-Processing Built In</p>
<p class="itemText">Well, as predicted, I worked on plugging my splitter script into the Processing tab in my layout. What I wound up with was this:</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">#</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">You turn on the Post-process checkbox, then put the full path to the script in the Path field. I added the output redirect to test.txt as a check to see whether the build did the right thing. There’s surely a way to redirect STEDRR also but I didn’t look it up. Turns out if the script explodes. Scrivener detects that and pops up a window giving you the error.</p>

<p class="itemText">And ...</p>

<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">As you see here, I have most everything turned off. Most of that is just personal preference, though smart quotes may have caused me a little trouble in the transition from Scrivener to markdown to GitHub. </p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">I’ve also adjusted my preference for date formatting, because I’m using Scrivener’s placeholders for date and time up at the top of this booklet.</p>

<p class="itemText">Here’s where the metaphorical rubber meets the virtual road. I’ve created a custom compile format, and it’s full of changes.</p>

<p class="topLevelItemTitle">Thoughts on Improvements</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Just as an experiment, I’ve put some text inside the folder that defines this section of thoughts. I did it by typing in the Scrivenings mode, though there are other ways of doing it, I’m sure. I expect that it’ll compile just fine and this will show up as an introductory paragraph in this (big) section.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">In the binder, the folder icon is now showing a little text indicator so that I can be aware there’s text in here.</p>

<p class="itemText">### Three or More Levels</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">I suspect when I next use Scrivener in earnest, I’ll go to three levels instead of the current two. I’ll have something like Section, Chapter, and Paragraphs. I don’t know, I’ll need better names but the idea will be to allow for major sections with identifiable formatting.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Sometimes in fiction chapters (especially), there’s another breakdown, often indicated by a little graphical widget in the text. If I wanted that I’m not sure if I’d do it with an additional level, ...</p>

<p class="itemText">### Auto Titles in Subs</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Relatedly, I’m typing titles fairly often in some of these parts of the project that are in folders. Since I include titles automatically in my top level layout, and since I’m using them often in the lower level, this, too is evidence that I need a deeper structure, and perhaps automatic titles all the way down, or most of the way down.</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">I’ll evolve that as I go on with other writings.</p>

<p class="itemTitle">Styles</p>
<p class="itemText">### Styles</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">Scrivener does allow you to use paragraph and font styles in your editor view, and has the ability to compile different output based on style. So in principle, at least, I could *italicize* the word “italicize” in my style, and have it compiled as \*italicize\*, so that it would show up in italics. </p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">I’m used to typing in plain text, and will probably stick with it, and I believe it might be difficult to set up otherwise. When I’ve set the mode in Scrivener that does that, it also es...</p>

<p class="itemText">### Spaces after titles</p>
<p class="itemText"></p>
<p class="itemText">I discovered that when Scrivener is rendering folder titles, they are compiled as “# Title #  “, with two trailing spaces, while documents are compiled as “# Title #”, with no spaces. </p>

<p class="itemText">I modified the splitter script to say</p>

<p class="itemText">Note: This subsequently turned out to be an anomaly in how I had defined my layouts. The settings in the TL;DR section are correct as of this writing.</p>
