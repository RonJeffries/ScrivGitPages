\f0\fs26 \cf0 Let\'92s go for it! Let\'92s publish what we have right now, and put it in a page with a known name, which we\'92ll retain for historical purposes. (I wonder if anyone will ever read this. A conversation yesterday tried to assure me that my mission is to emit my own behavior and not worry about whether other people find it useful. Years of Irish Catholic upbringing, however, make that hard to do.\
\
Thinking out loud here, I believe we\'92ll do two things. First, we\'92ll compile this, as is, to a convenient name like v20180615.md, namely today\'92s date. Then we\'92ll update the README, for now. Then, we\'92ll create an index file, etc., as time goes on.\
\
It actually went up, and if you want to look at it, it\'92s at [{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ronjeffries.github.io/scriv-git-pages/v20180615.md/v20180615.html"}}{\fldrslt https://ronjeffries.github.io/scriv-git-pages/v20180615.md/v20180615.html}}]({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ronjeffries.github.io/scriv-git-pages/v20180615.md/v20180615.html"}}{\fldrslt https://ronjeffries.github.io/scriv-git-pages/v20180615.md/v20180615.html}}). Of course, you won\'92t know to look until we get things at least a bit better arranged. I\'92ll leave that file there, but a story goes with it.\
