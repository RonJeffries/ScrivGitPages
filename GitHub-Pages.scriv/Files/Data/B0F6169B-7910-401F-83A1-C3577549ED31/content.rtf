\f0\fs26 \cf0 Scrivener lets you assign \'93Styles\'94 to paragraphs, and you can control how those styles get compiled into the output. So, in principle, I could set up a \'93Heading 2\'94 style such that when I format a paragraph with Heading 2, it would look different in my editor, and (I believe) I could make it compile with the ## in front of it that signify H2 to Markdown. For now, I\'92m not going to do that: I\'92m going to type my own Markdown marks, because I\'92m used to it.\

Perhaps we\'92ll come back to the topic of styles, for now, let\'92s move on \'85}
