# Thoughts on Improvements #


Just as an experiment, I’ve put some text inside the folder that defines this section of thoughts. I did it by typing in the Scrivenings mode, though there are other ways of doing it, I’m sure. I expect that it’ll compile just fine and this will show up as an introductory paragraph in this (big) section.

In the binder, the folder icon is now showing a little text indicator so that I can be aware there’s text in here.

### Three or More Levels

I suspect when I next use Scrivener in earnest, I’ll go to three levels instead of the current two. I’ll have something like Section, Chapter, and Paragraphs. I don’t know, I’ll need better names but the idea will be to allow for major sections with identifiable formatting.

Sometimes in fiction chapters (especially), there’s another breakdown, often indicated by a little graphical widget in the text. If I wanted that I’m not sure if I’d do it with an additional level, or perhaps just a new layout. I just have an inkling that there’ll be more to do.

In fact, I’m typing in titles like the one above, which is a pretty clear indication that I have in mind more structure than is presently defined in my format and layouts.  

### Auto Titles in Subs

Relatedly, I’m typing titles fairly often in some of these parts of the project that are in folders. Since I include titles automatically in my top level layout, and since I’m using them often in the lower level, this, too is evidence that I need a deeper structure, and perhaps automatic titles all the way down, or most of the way down.

I’ll evolve that as I go on with other writings.  

### Styles

Scrivener does allow you to use paragraph and font styles in your editor view, and has the ability to compile different output based on style. So in principle, at least, I could *italicize* the word “italicize” in my style, and have it compiled as \*italicize\*, so that it would show up in italics. 

I’m used to typing in plain text, and will probably stick with it, and I believe it might be difficult to set up otherwise. When I’ve set the mode in Scrivener that does that, it also escapes all my own markup, so I think I’d have to convert all the way. 

Possibly, there’s another way to do it, by associating a compiled form with any styling I used. That would take experimentation, and since I’m comfortable writing my own markup, I’ll probably keep doing it that way.

You might wish to go another way.  

### Experimenting with Styles ###

I’m going to set a style on the above line, rather than type the usual pound signs in front of it, and then see if I can make it compile to a heading. At this moment I have no idea how to do that.

I left some styles defined, so I’ve set the above line to Heading 2. I’ll compile to see what, if anything, it does. … The first result is nothing: it compiles as plain text. Time to do a bit of study.

Two quick learnings:

First, in compile, editing the layout, in the Styles section, you can associate prefix and suffix with styles. I’ve done it like this:

Note that I’ve set the first prefix / suffix panes, to pound-pound-space and space-pound-pound. I’m really not sure whether I should have used the second panes, Paragraph prefix/suffix instead but this worked, the line comes out with pounds around it as intended.

Since this section is compiled using level 3 headers, I then defined a level three heading style. I did that by formatting a line to bold 13 point, then the Format menu lets you define that as a style. Then I set the prefixes as above, but to three pound signs rather than two. And it compiles just as one would hope.  So the top of this page looks like this:

On the preceding page, I’ve formatted manually with pound signs, like this:

I don’t know. I could get to liking that. The styles have shortcut keys, command 5 and such, so maybe I’ll try using them a bit and see how I feel about it. So far it seems I can use them interchangeably.
